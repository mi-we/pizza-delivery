# pizza-delivery

Simple Selenium and Scenarioo demo in Java.

## Production code

The production code is a very simple pizza ordering web app without a dynamic backend. It's all in the folder `prod`.

To serve this as a website there is a `gh-pages` branch.

If you can't wait to see the pizza awesomeness, look [here](http://adiherzog.github.io/pizza-delivery/prod/index.html) ;-)

Usage hint: The only known phone number is 0791111111, all other phone numbers require you to enter a new delivery address.

## Test code

The test code is based on Java using Selenium for the Browser automatisation and Scenarioo for documenting the test cases. You'll find this code in the folder `test`.
