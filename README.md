# pizza-delivery
This is an example web application is used to demonstrate how to use the Scenarioo Writer Library 
in your Selenium Webtests to produce Scenarioo Documentation data.

If you can't wait to see the pizza ordering awesomeness, look [here](http://scenarioo.github.io/pizza-delivery) ;-)

Usage hint: The only known phone number is 0791111111, all other phone numbers require you to enter a new delivery 
address.

To see how this application can be documented using Scenarioo, look
