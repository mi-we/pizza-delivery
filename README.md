Simple Selenium and Scenarioo demo in Java.

## Production code

The production code is a very simple pizza ordering web app without a dynamic backend. It's all in the folder `prod`.

If you can't wait to see the pizza awesomeness, look [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/adiherzog/pizza-delivery/blob/master/prod/index.html) ;-)

## Test code

The test code is based on Java using Selenium for the Browser automatisation and Scenarioo for documenting the test cases. You'll find this code in the folder `test`.
